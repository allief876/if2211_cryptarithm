# CryptarithmCalc

## What is this?
This program is created to solve Cryptarithms problem by using Brute Force strategy. Assignment from IF2211: Algorithm Strategy

## Any requirements to run this?
Python 3.9, any OS would be fine.

## Okay, how to run this?
I assume you use Windows 10:
1. Open terminal (CMD) in the source code directory (src)
2. Type this in your terminal/CMD:
```py main.py```
3. You run the program now! Yippie!
4. Input the test case from the files, example:
```../test/tc1.txt```
5. Watch as the Cryptarithm break (Or not, because not all of it was solvable).
